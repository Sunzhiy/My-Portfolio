        Hi, I'm Jason Sun, a Computer Science graduate from the University of
        Houston. Iâ€™m passionate about web development and love building dynamic,
        user-friendly apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. One of my key
        projects involved creating a real-time data management app with React
        and Redux, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and love for
        impactful solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments and am
        excited to contribute to meaningful projects in the tech field.
